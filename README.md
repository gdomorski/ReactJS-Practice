# ReactJS-Practice

React is an awesome emerging framework that is fun to learn. Basically it bundles HTML / Javascript, into "components". JSX makes components easily understandable.

I have been following Tyler McGinnis' React Tutorial online. Jesse Skinner's tutorial has also been helpful. I have  been watching multiple youtube videos as well.
