# ReactJS-Practice

React is an awesome emerging framework that is fun to learn. Although it is more of a "view" than a complete framework like Angular, it is very useful. Basically it bundles HTML / Javascript, called "components". JSX makes components easily understandable.

I have been following Tyler McGinnis' React Tutorial online. I have also been watching multiple youtube videos.
